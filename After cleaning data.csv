0,"The entire movie looked like Video game art from Budokai Tenkaichi cut scenes. The art style was completely different than the original Dragon Ball Super series. It was incredibly disappointing and definitely ruined any enjoyment I had watching the movie.Gohans transformation was incredibly Anticlimactic and boring, and absolutely no back story, he just randomly transforms from being far weaker than he was in the Tournament of Power... Again, the animation of the characters was so off it looked like fan art from photoshop.Lastly is the creation of Cell Max. This was one of the worst parts of the movie, being that they claimed he was far superior to the original Cell. But he could not talk, he didn't heal automatically, or regenerate, and he was unrealistically large like a giant. No back story to how they improved him from the original (did they get cells from other aliens that visit the planet like Beerus, or Whis etc?) They should have definitely kept him closer to the original Perfect Cell but more powerful and intelligent and change his appearance slightly. Having Wings was pointless as pretty much everyone can fly with energy.. he could have powered up to fly away instead of using his wings..Great Plot though, had a good story too it. Just incredibly disappointing designs and lack of information.",entire movie looked like video game art budokai tenkaichi cut scenes art style completely different original dragon ball super series incredibly disappointing definitely ruined enjoyment watching moviegohans transformation incredibly anticlimactic boring absolutely back story randomly transforms far weaker tournament power animation characters looked like fan art photoshoplastly creation cell max one worst parts movie claimed far superior original cell could talk didnt heal automatically regenerate unrealistically large like giant back story improved original get cells aliens visit planet like beerus whis etc definitely kept closer original perfect cell powerful intelligent change appearance slightly wings pointless pretty much everyone fly energy could powered fly away instead using wingsgreat plot though good story incredibly disappointing designs lack information
1,"I'm not a Dragon Ball fan, the only times I've watched it was back in childhood, when DB and DBZ were streamed on TV. So it's needless to say, that I went into it clueless with some very old and general knowledge of the series, thinking it's gonna be a waste of my time. But to my surprise I genuinely enjoyed the movie. It was really fun and lighthearted story, that casual (in this series) like me, would like. I could understand why some fans of the series might hate it as it's just a filler and doesn't really feature main characters that much or add some depth to the story and so on. Does the story have some deeper meaning? No. Does it rely on Dragon Ball on Dragon Ball series' jokes? Yes. But it's the nostalgia and some Dragon Ball well known shticks, that made whole theater burst out laughing several times during the movie. This self-awarness and campiness is what really sold me on it (also Piccolo and his big titties being main protagonist(-s), honestly, I remember liking Piccolo as a kid and this movie brought back that fondness, but in a slightly different way). Didn't mind the 3d animation, just in faster paced action scenes did it bother me a bit with cgi being too visible (if that makes sense). The color palette for the movie was pretty too. Overall an enjoyable, fun and easy watch.",im dragon ball fan times ive watched back childhood db dbz streamed tv needless say went clueless old general knowledge series thinking gonna waste time surprise genuinely enjoyed movie really fun lighthearted story casual series like would like could understand fans series might hate filler doesnt really feature main characters much add depth story story deeper meaning rely dragon ball dragon ball series jokes yes nostalgia dragon ball well known shticks made whole theater burst laughing several times movie selfawarness campiness really sold also piccolo big titties main protagonists honestly remember liking piccolo kid movie brought back fondness slightly different way didnt mind animation faster paced action scenes bother bit cgi visible makes sense color palette movie pretty overall enjoyable fun easy watch

The graphics and cgi with a mix of 2D and 3D it's very very nice!This movie showed that they care about other characters besides goku and vegeta! I love they tell much more of the life of other characters and the new ones , I really love that they create new relations on some characters and other ones from past movies.I think it's a movie that is very good too watch with friends and family !

3,"To be honest, at first I was really concerned about the CGI-Animation. Since DBS Broly looked so great with the shintani art style, It was really sad to hear this movie would not get the same treatment.After I saw the movie, I have to say: This is a really great Dragon Ball Movie and I am very happy with it. The animations are really good, the CGI looks really great. The story- althought not being the greatest- made sense and was different. Even though Goku and Vegeta did not play an important role in the movie, It was really fun to see Piccolo and Gohan in the main character role. The fights were amazing, and the movie had a great climax with Beast Gohan beating Cell Max. The only negative point would be the short period of time we saw Beast Gohan. But at the end of the day, It is a movie so the amount of time it has is limited.Overall a great movie.",honest first really concerned cgianimation since dbs broly looked great shintani art style really sad hear movie would get treatmentafter saw movie say really great dragon ball movie happy animations really good cgi looks really great story althought greatest made sense different even though goku vegeta play important role movie really fun see piccolo gohan main character role fights amazing movie great climax beast gohan beating cell max negative point would short period time saw beast gohan end day movie amount time limitedoverall great movie
4,"As A Dragon Ball Fan From India It Was Delight To Watch It In Theatre After So Many Years And As Toriyama's Statements That Gohan Can Be Powerful If He Wanted To, This Time We Saw It.

Also The Animation Style That Dragon Ball Used Is Pretty Unique This Time And It Should Be Given A Chance Watching Such New Animation Style In Theatres Worked For Me But It Varies For Everyone.

5,Horrible storyline with even worse transformation. Nothing is original. They basically gave baby vegeta's look to gohan and turned cell into bio broly.,horrible storyline even worse transformation nothing original basically gave baby vegetas look gohan turned cell bio broly
6,"This is one of the few dragon ball movies that actually have story to follow and not just 10 minutes of text+ 1 hour of punches (which is what most of the people want anyway). It has great visuals even tho i was skeptical because of the cgi, i was gladly wrong.It makes sense that they could have been able to recreate Cell, since RRA were the only ones with the data from Dr Gero and his projects.Also love the fact that we can see how things developt when there's no Goku or Vegeta around to save the day.It has a good amount of fan service (Gohan Blanco), a new form for a fan favorite character (Piccolo), and the enemys have a motivation, (not like you, 90's Broly).

7,First of all the story is really just a mix of android/cell saga and bio broly movie. Which would have been ok as DB movies never have stories imho. Its more about the villain and cool action.And this is where the problems begin. That cell Monster? Idk I think it sucked. Piccolo is really the mvp of this movie. Spy action. Clever moves. Wishes from shenron. Tacniques he didnt use since classic DB. Its all there and I loved it. His new form im a little torn. I think the fact he finally gets simething is awesome. Well deserved screentime here.Gohan tho? Honestly the movie could have been a 8 or 9 for me if gohan was just completely not in it. Its so annoying he just transforms into something not even very special in the end and blasts the big bad dead. With piccolos move that he never used before. Stupid. Devalued piccolos power up big time and really destroyed the whole movie. At least for me.,first story really mix androidcell saga bio broly movie would ok db movies never stories imho villain cool actionand problems begin cell monster idk think sucked piccolo really mvp movie spy action clever moves wishes shenron tacniques didnt use since classic db loved new form im little torn think fact finally gets simething awesome well deserved screentime heregohan tho honestly movie could gohan completely annoying transforms something even special end blasts big bad dead piccolos move never used stupid devalued piccolos power big time really destroyed whole movie least

9,"A great addition to Super if you're a casual DBZ/S fan, and a must-watch if you're a Piccolo or Gohan fan! Man, did it feel refreshing to see them take the spotlight! Its issues mostly lie with pacing and way too much Red Ribbon backstory clogging up the run time, the worst offender being Toei missing a perfect opportunity to reprise Great Saiyaman, ESPECIALLY when ""superhero"" is its namesake!The comedy was on-point and had me laughing at every other line! Pan was adorable and the Gammas were love at first sight; they stole the second act and had the best fight in the movie. The CG is well-done and and really takes advantage of the cinematography and fighting choreography.

10,Been a loyal fan of the dragon ball franchise for 25+ years and this film really reinforced what my feelings have been for the last couple years.I enjoyed the Latest Broly film and there was some good parts of dragon ball super but on the whole they have ruined the franchise through making it seems like the audience they are aiming for are very young children? If you compare this latest film with dragon ball Z it really is sad to see how much it has regressed. I was sat in the cinema and it was actually to the point where it was painful it was that bad! No wonder fan made dragon ball anime on YT is getting removed when it is so much better than the rubbish they seem to be producing now!The transformations in this particular film make absolute no sense and the animation imo is shockingly bad. This was the GOAT programme but now the likes of demon slayer and AOT is leaving dragon ball for dust!I cannot understand how people who are life long dragon ball fans can rate this film so highly?

11,"This movie was very bad, Dragon ball characters have always been characterized by showing their personality, in this movie the villain doesn't even say a word, he has no personality.Some people who have always been in the story lose their essence, for example Bulma leaves aside the technology for aesthetic things, as well as Pikoro and his change of attitude and tolerance towards the villain.For the creation of a Cell Max should have given more details of its operation, origin, reason for creation and also seems a little out of the story, as Trunks and Crilin finish with the laboratory and destroy everything related to the creation of cell, only take the plans of Android 17 and 18, so it was almost impossible to get all that information.I didn't like it, it's a movie made for 6-9 year old kids who don't need to know the story and laugh at simple jokes.",movie bad dragon ball characters always characterized showing personality movie villain doesnt even say word personalitysome people always story lose essence example bulma leaves aside technology aesthetic things well pikoro change attitude tolerance towards villainfor creation cell max given details operation origin reason creation also seems little story trunks crilin finish laboratory destroy everything related creation cell take plans android almost impossible get informationi didnt like movie made year old kids dont need know story laugh simple jokes
12,"Like honestly, Akira, you are ruining your legacy. This had so much potential, what is this. Piccolo's big transformation is called Orange piccolo. Like come on man and it's just a worse cell saga. The only reason goku and vegeta were in the movie even for a little while is cuz they're the face of dragon ball super. But they took cell's design and took everything that made him good away from him, and then they had the gall to say that they used Dr. Gero's documents for it. COME ON, HE WASN'T EVEN IN PERFECT FORM. And another thing that made cell great that they took from Cell max is his intelligence. Cell max was said to be complete in the movie he was just beserk the entire time.",like honestly akira ruining legacy much potential piccolos big transformation called orange piccolo like come man worse cell saga reason goku vegeta movie even little cuz theyre face dragon ball super took cells design took everything made good away gall say used dr geros documents come wasnt even perfect form another thing made cell great took cell max intelligence cell max said complete movie beserk entire time
13,As title states. Highly disappointed in this and I've tried every single outlet short of Disney plus. If anybody has the link and is capable of sharing it with me that would be great. I just want to watch the movie but I like in Canada and that apparently makes me ineligible to watch the movie. It makes zero sense also that I have to write 600 words just to make this complaint. North America needs to regulate its viewing licenses better and have a proper control over who may and who may not view or purchase content. 1/10 and that's going to stay that way. How absurd is it that this far passed release I still can't watch it in Canada.,title states highly disappointed ive tried every single outlet short disney plus anybody link capable sharing would great want watch movie like canada apparently makes ineligible watch movie makes zero sense also write words make complaint north america needs regulate viewing licenses better proper control may may view purchase content thats going stay way absurd far passed release still cant watch canada
14,"This movie is a breathe of fresh air. High stakes, world ending drama that only the master Akira Toriyama can produce. It is a beautifully written & gorgeously animated story that puts Gohan & Piccolo as its centerpieces. Instead of a typical Dragon Ball storyline where the staples of the franchise(Goku & Vegeta) step in and save the day because only they are strong enough to defeat the villain. This movie focuses more on past supporting characters and allows them to shine as the heros. And shine they did! It's wonderful to see Gohan finally gets to show his true potential & power on screen and not just have it be talked about as a potential in the future. They dangled that carrot long enough. Pan's character arc made great strides in this film. It wasn't a lot, but it also wasn't over the top or overbearing. I'm very excited to see how her story progresses under the teachings of Piccolo(like father, like daughter). Trunks and Goten finally becoming teenagers is long over due and was something I was very happy to see. And the newest edition to the franchise, 'Gamma 2.' Gamma 2 is an awesome edition to the Dragon Ball roster. His personality, fighting style & abilities are not overly OP for an android. Hollywood could take a few notes from this movie on how to introduce a new character in a long storied & successful franchise(seriously).This is a fantastic movie. However it is not perfect. It does have its imperfections within the script, but I would like to preface, my gripes are very minimal & I don't think had these changes been implimented. It would not have improved upon the movie very much. The trailers from last summer felt misleading after watching. I'm very pleased with where this movie went and the areas it explored for the Gohan fandom that has been asking for this for 30+ years. However, I wish it could have been a tad more upfront about this instead of using Goku and Vegeta as its main selling point during the marketing campaign for its release. It's great that Gohan finally was able to break through his ceiling and being pushed beyond his limits. What lost me a bit was he shouldn't have been able to do so, given his lack of continuous training. Piccolo made a strong point of emphasis about this early in the film. He was only able to do so because of the hollywood Vin Diesel syndrome. ""Family."" The fact this franchise was built on the backs of Goku & Vegeta, it would have been nice to see them get more than 15 minutes of screen time throughout its runtime. It would have been nice to see what progress they both made in their training with Whis since their fight with Broly. With that being said, I'd like to reiterate that these are very minor gripes, and changing these things would not really improve upon the story.To sumerize, this was a fantastic story that introduced new characters and expanded upon several of the franchises' most beloved characters. I'm very excited to see how Toriyama implements Pan & Gamma 2, the ever expanding universe of Dragon Ball Super.",movie breathe fresh air high stakes world ending drama master akira toriyama produce beautifully written gorgeously animated story puts gohan piccolo centerpieces instead typical dragon ball storyline staples franchisegoku vegeta step save day strong enough defeat villain movie focuses past supporting characters allows shine heros shine wonderful see gohan finally gets show true potential power screen talked potential future dangled carrot long enough pans character arc made great strides film wasnt lot also wasnt top overbearing im excited see story progresses teachings piccololike father like daughter trunks goten finally becoming teenagers long due something happy see newest edition franchise gamma gamma awesome edition dragon ball roster personality fighting style abilities overly op android hollywood could take notes movie introduce new character long storied successful franchiseseriouslythis fantastic movie however perfect imperfections within script would like preface gripes minimal dont think changes implimented would improved upon movie much trailers last summer felt misleading watching im pleased movie went areas explored gohan fandom asking years however wish could tad upfront instead using goku vegeta main selling point marketing campaign release great gohan finally able break ceiling pushed beyond limits lost bit shouldnt able given lack continuous training piccolo made strong point emphasis early film able hollywood vin diesel syndrome family fact franchise built backs goku vegeta would nice see get minutes screen time throughout runtime would nice see progress made training whis since fight broly said id like reiterate minor gripes changing things would really improve upon storyto sumerize fantastic story introduced new characters expanded upon several franchises beloved characters im excited see toriyama implements pan gamma ever expanding universe dragon ball super

They should have definitely kept him closer to the original Perfect Cell but more powerful and intelligent and change his appearance slightly.

No wonder fan made dragon ball anime on YT is getting removed when it is so much better than the rubbish they seem to be producing now!The transformations in this particular film make absolute no sense and the animation imo is shockingly bad. This was the GOAT programme but now the likes of demon slayer and AOT is leaving dragon ball for dust!I cannot understand how people who are life long dragon ball fans can rate this film so highly? I never write reviews but I was that disappointed I felt I had to!,loyal fan dragon ball franchise years film really reinforced feelings last couple yearsi enjoyed latest broly film good parts dragon ball super whole ruined franchise making seems like audience aiming young children compare latest film dragon ball z really sad see much regressed sat cinema actually point painful bad wonder fan made dragon ball anime yt getting removed much better rubbish seem producing nowthe transformations particular film make absolute sense animation imo shockingly bad goat programme likes demon slayer aot leaving dragon ball dusti cannot understand people life long dragon ball fans rate film highly never write reviews disappointed felt
26,"This movie was very bad, Dragon ball characters have always been characterized by showing their personality, in this movie the villain doesn't even say a word, he has no personality.Some people who have always been in the story lose their essence, for example Bulma leaves aside the technology for aesthetic things, as well as Pikoro and his change of attitude and tolerance towards the villain.For the creation of a Cell Max should have given more details of its operation, origin, reason for creation and also seems a little out of the story, as Trunks and Crilin finish with the laboratory and destroy everything related to the creation of cell, only take the plans of Android 17 and 18, so it was almost impossible to get all that information.I didn't like it, it's a movie made for 6-9 year old kids who don't need to know the story and laugh at simple jokes.",movie bad dragon ball characters always characterized showing personality movie villain doesnt even say word personalitysome people always story lose essence example bulma leaves aside technology aesthetic things well pikoro change attitude tolerance towards villainfor creation cell max given details operation origin reason creation also seems little story trunks crilin finish laboratory destroy everything related creation cell take plans android almost impossible get informationi didnt like movie made year old kids dont need know story laugh simple jokes
27,"Like honestly, Akira, you are ruining your legacy. This had so much potential, what is this. Piccolo's big transformation is called Orange piccolo. Like come on man and it's just a worse cell saga. The only reason goku and vegeta were in the movie even for a little while is cuz they're the face of dragon ball super. But they took cell's design and took everything that made him good away from him, and then they had the gall to say that they used Dr. Gero's documents for it. COME ON, HE WASN'T EVEN IN PERFECT FORM. And another thing that made cell great that they took from Cell max is his intelligence. Cell max was said to be complete in the movie he was just beserk the entire time.",like honestly akira ruining legacy much potential piccolos big transformation called orange piccolo like come man worse cell saga reason goku vegeta movie even little cuz theyre face dragon ball super took cells design took everything made good away gall say used dr geros documents come wasnt even perfect form another thing made cell great took cell max intelligence cell max said complete movie beserk entire time
28,As title states. Highly disappointed in this and I've tried every single outlet short of Disney plus. If anybody has the link and is capable of sharing it with me that would be great. I just want to watch the movie but I like in Canada and that apparently makes me ineligible to watch the movie. It makes zero sense also that I have to write 600 words just to make this complaint. North America needs to regulate its viewing licenses better and have a proper control over who may and who may not view or purchase content. 1/10 and that's going to stay that way. How absurd is it that this far passed release I still can't watch it in Canada.,title states highly disappointed ive tried every single outlet short disney plus anybody link capable sharing would great want watch movie like canada apparently makes ineligible watch movie makes zero sense also write words make complaint north america needs regulate viewing licenses better proper control may may view purchase content thats going stay way absurd far passed release still cant watch canada
29,"This movie is a breathe of fresh air. High stakes, world ending drama that only the master Akira Toriyama can produce. It is a beautifully written & gorgeously animated story that puts Gohan & Piccolo as its centerpieces. Instead of a typical Dragon Ball storyline where the staples of the franchise(Goku & Vegeta) step in and save the day because only they are strong enough to defeat the villain. This movie focuses more on past supporting characters and allows them to shine as the heros. And shine they did! It's wonderful to see Gohan finally gets to show his true potential & power on screen and not just have it be talked about as a potential in the future. They dangled that carrot long enough. Pan's character arc made great strides in this film. It wasn't a lot, but it also wasn't over the top or overbearing. I'm very excited to see how her story progresses under the teachings of Piccolo(like father, like daughter). Trunks and Goten finally becoming teenagers is long over due and was something I was very happy to see. And the newest edition to the franchise, 'Gamma 2.' Gamma 2 is an awesome edition to the Dragon Ball roster. His personality, fighting style & abilities are not overly OP for an android. Hollywood could take a few notes from this movie on how to introduce a new character in a long storied & successful franchise(seriously).This is a fantastic movie. However it is not perfect. It does have its imperfections within the script, but I would like to preface, my gripes are very minimal & I don't think had these changes been implimented. It would not have improved upon the movie very much. The trailers from last summer felt misleading after watching. I'm very pleased with where this movie went and the areas it explored for the Gohan fandom that has been asking for this for 30+ years. However, I wish it could have been a tad more upfront about this instead of using Goku and Vegeta as its main selling point during the marketing campaign for its release. It's great that Gohan finally was able to break through his ceiling and being pushed beyond his limits. What lost me a bit was he shouldn't have been able to do so, given his lack of continuous training. Piccolo made a strong point of emphasis about this early in the film. He was only able to do so because of the hollywood Vin Diesel syndrome. ""Family."" The fact this franchise was built on the backs of Goku & Vegeta, it would have been nice to see them get more than 15 minutes of screen time throughout its runtime. It would have been nice to see what progress they both made in their training with Whis since their fight with Broly. With that being said, I'd like to reiterate that these are very minor gripes, and changing these things would not really improve upon the story.To sumerize, this was a fantastic story that introduced new characters and expanded upon several of the franchises' most beloved characters. I'm very excited to see how Toriyama implements Pan & Gamma 2, the ever expanding universe of Dragon Ball Super.",movie breathe fresh air high stakes world ending drama master akira toriyama produce beautifully written gorgeously animated story puts gohan piccolo centerpieces instead typical dragon ball storyline staples franchisegoku vegeta step save day strong enough defeat villain movie focuses past supporting characters allows shine heros shine wonderful see gohan finally gets show true potential power screen talked potential future dangled carrot long enough pans character arc made great strides film wasnt lot also wasnt top overbearing im excited see story progresses teachings piccololike father like daughter trunks goten finally becoming teenagers long due something happy see newest edition franchise gamma gamma awesome edition dragon ball roster personality fighting style abilities overly op android hollywood could take notes movie introduce new character long storied successful franchiseseriouslythis fantastic movie however perfect imperfections within script would like preface gripes minimal dont think changes implimented would improved upon movie much trailers last summer felt misleading watching im pleased movie went areas explored gohan fandom asking years however wish could tad upfront instead using goku vegeta main selling point marketing campaign release great gohan finally able break ceiling pushed beyond limits lost bit shouldnt able given lack continuous training piccolo made strong point emphasis early film able hollywood vin diesel syndrome family fact franchise built backs goku vegeta would nice see get minutes screen time throughout runtime would nice see progress made training whis since fight broly said id like reiterate minor gripes changing things would really improve upon storyto sumerize fantastic story introduced new characters expanded upon several franchises beloved characters im excited see toriyama implements pan gamma ever expanding universe dragon ball super
30,"The entire movie looked like Video game art from Budokai Tenkaichi cut scenes. The art style was completely different than the original Dragon Ball Super series. It was incredibly disappointing and definitely ruined any enjoyment I had watching the movie.Gohans transformation was incredibly Anticlimactic and boring, and absolutely no back story, he just randomly transforms from being far weaker than he was in the Tournament of Power... Again, the animation of the characters was so off it looked like fan art from photoshop.Lastly is the creation of Cell Max. This was one of the worst parts of the movie, being that they claimed he was far superior to the original Cell. But he could not talk, he didn't heal automatically, or regenerate, and he was unrealistically large like a giant. No back story to how they improved him from the original (did they get cells from other aliens that visit the planet like Beerus, or Whis etc?) They should have definitely kept him closer to the original Perfect Cell but more powerful and intelligent and change his appearance slightly. Having Wings was pointless as pretty much everyone can fly with energy.. he could have powered up to fly away instead of using his wings..Great Plot though, had a good story too it. Just incredibly disappointing designs and lack of information.",entire movie looked like video game art budokai tenkaichi cut scenes art style completely different original dragon ball super series incredibly disappointing definitely ruined enjoyment watching moviegohans transformation incredibly anticlimactic boring absolutely back story randomly transforms far weaker tournament power animation characters looked like fan art photoshoplastly creation cell max one worst parts movie claimed far superior original cell could talk didnt heal automatically regenerate unrealistically large like giant back story improved original get cells aliens visit planet like beerus whis etc definitely kept closer original perfect cell powerful intelligent change appearance slightly wings pointless pretty much everyone fly energy could powered fly away instead using wingsgreat plot though good story incredibly disappointing designs lack information
31,"I'm not a Dragon Ball fan, the only times I've watched it was back in childhood, when DB and DBZ were streamed on TV. So it's needless to say, that I went into it clueless with some very old and general knowledge of the series, thinking it's gonna be a waste of my time. But to my surprise I genuinely enjoyed the movie. It was really fun and lighthearted story, that casual (in this series) like me, would like. I could understand why some fans of the series might hate it as it's just a filler and doesn't really feature main characters that much or add some depth to the story and so on. Does the story have some deeper meaning? No. Does it rely on Dragon Ball on Dragon Ball series' jokes? Yes. But it's the nostalgia and some Dragon Ball well known shticks, that made whole theater burst out laughing several times during the movie. This self-awarness and campiness is what really sold me on it (also Piccolo and his big titties being main protagonist(-s), honestly, I remember liking Piccolo as a kid and this movie brought back that fondness, but in a slightly different way). Didn't mind the 3d animation, just in faster paced action scenes did it bother me a bit with cgi being too visible (if that makes sense). The color palette for the movie was pretty too. Overall an enjoyable, fun and easy watch.",im dragon ball fan times ive watched back childhood db dbz streamed tv needless say went clueless old general knowledge series thinking gonna waste time surprise genuinely enjoyed movie really fun lighthearted story casual series like would like could understand fans series might hate filler doesnt really feature main characters much add depth story story deeper meaning rely dragon ball dragon ball series jokes yes nostalgia dragon ball well known shticks made whole theater burst laughing several times movie selfawarness campiness really sold also piccolo big titties main protagonists honestly remember liking piccolo kid movie brought back fondness slightly different way didnt mind animation faster paced action scenes bother bit cgi visible makes sense color palette movie pretty overall enjoyable fun easy watch

The graphics and cgi with a mix of 2D and 3D it's very very nice!This movie showed that they care about other characters besides goku and vegeta!

33,"To be honest, at first I was really concerned about the CGI-Animation. Since DBS Broly looked so great with the shintani art style, It was really sad to hear this movie would not get the same treatment.After I saw the movie, I have to say: This is a really great Dragon Ball Movie and I am very happy with it. The animations are really good, the CGI looks really great. The story- althought not being the greatest- made sense and was different. Even though Goku and Vegeta did not play an important role in the movie, It was really fun to see Piccolo and Gohan in the main character role. The fights were amazing, and the movie had a great climax with Beast Gohan beating Cell Max. The only negative point would be the short period of time we saw Beast Gohan. But at the end of the day, It is a movie so the amount of time it has is limited.Overall a great movie.",honest first really concerned cgianimation since dbs broly looked great shintani art style really sad hear movie would get treatmentafter saw movie say really great dragon ball movie happy animations really good cgi looks really great story althought greatest made sense different even though goku vegeta play important role movie really fun see piccolo gohan main character role fights amazing movie great climax beast gohan beating cell max negative point would short period time saw beast gohan end day movie amount time limitedoverall great movie
34,"As A Dragon Ball Fan From India It Was Delight To Watch It In Theatre After So Many Years And As Toriyama's Statements That Gohan Can Be Powerful If He Wanted To, This Time We Saw It. Goku & Vegeta Don't Get Much Time In This Movie It's Properly Based On Piccolo & Gohan. Plot Of Movie Is 100% Dragon Ball Style Action Filled With Situational Comedy But As Run Time Is Less Movie Lacks In Properly Setting The Plot. Also The Animation Style That Dragon Ball Used Is Pretty Unique This Time And It Should Be Given A Chance Watching Such New Animation Style In Theatres Worked For Me But It Varies For Everyone.

36,"This is one of the few dragon ball movies that actually have story to follow and not just 10 minutes of text+ 1 hour of punches (which is what most of the people want anyway). It has great visuals even tho i was skeptical because of the cgi, i was gladly wrong.It makes sense that they could have been able to recreate Cell, since RRA were the only ones with the data from Dr Gero and his projects.Also love the fact that we can see how things developt when there's no Goku or Vegeta around to save the day.It has a good amount of fan service (Gohan Blanco), a new form for a fan favorite character (Piccolo), and the enemys have a motivation, (not like you, 90's Broly).

37,First of all the story is really just a mix of android/cell saga and bio broly movie. Which would have been ok as DB movies never have stories imho. Its more about the villain and cool action.And this is where the problems begin. That cell Monster? Idk I think it sucked. Piccolo is really the mvp of this movie. Spy action. Clever moves. Wishes from shenron. Tacniques he didnt use since classic DB. Its all there and I loved it. His new form im a little torn. I think the fact he finally gets simething is awesome. Well deserved screentime here.Gohan tho? Honestly the movie could have been a 8 or 9 for me if gohan was just completely not in it. Its so annoying he just transforms into something not even very special in the end and blasts the big bad dead. With piccolos move that he never used before. Stupid. Devalued piccolos power up big time and really destroyed the whole movie. At least for me.,first story really mix androidcell saga bio broly movie would ok db movies never stories imho villain cool actionand problems begin cell monster idk think sucked piccolo really mvp movie spy action clever moves wishes shenron tacniques didnt use since classic db loved new form im little torn think fact finally gets simething awesome well deserved screentime heregohan tho honestly movie could gohan completely annoying transforms something even special end blasts big bad dead piccolos move never used stupid devalued piccolos power big time really destroyed whole movie least

39,"A great addition to Super if you're a casual DBZ/S fan, and a must-watch if you're a Piccolo or Gohan fan! Man, did it feel refreshing to see them take the spotlight!

Pan was adorable and the Gammas were love at first sight; they stole the second act and had the best fight in the movie.

48,"To be honest, at first I was really concerned about the CGI-Animation. Since DBS Broly looked so great with the shintani art style, It was really sad to hear this movie would not get the same treatment.After I saw the movie, I have to say: This is a really great Dragon Ball Movie and I am very happy with it. The animations are really good, the CGI looks really great. The story- althought not being the greatest- made sense and was different. Even though Goku and Vegeta did not play an important role in the movie, It was really fun to see Piccolo and Gohan in the main character role. The fights were amazing, and the movie had a great climax with Beast Gohan beating Cell Max. The only negative point would be the short period of time we saw Beast Gohan. But at the end of the day, It is a movie so the amount of time it has is limited.Overall a great movie.",honest first really concerned cgianimation since dbs broly looked great shintani art style really sad hear movie would get treatmentafter saw movie say really great dragon ball movie happy animations really good cgi looks really great story althought greatest made sense different even though goku vegeta play important role movie really fun see piccolo gohan main character role fights amazing movie great climax beast gohan beating cell max negative point would short period time saw beast gohan end day movie amount time limitedoverall great movie

51,"This is one of the few dragon ball movies that actually have story to follow and not just 10 minutes of text+ 1 hour of punches (which is what most of the people want anyway). It has great visuals even tho i was skeptical because of the cgi, i was gladly wrong.It makes sense that they could have been able to recreate Cell, since RRA were the only ones with the data from Dr Gero and his projects.Also love the fact that we can see how things developt when there's no Goku or Vegeta around to save the day.It has a good amount of fan service (Gohan Blanco), a new form for a fan favorite character (Piccolo), and the enemys have a motivation, (not like you, 90's Broly).

52,First of all the story is really just a mix of android/cell saga and bio broly movie. Which would have been ok as DB movies never have stories imho. Its more about the villain and cool action.And this is where the problems begin. That cell Monster? Idk I think it sucked. Piccolo is really the mvp of this movie. Spy action. Clever moves. Wishes from shenron. Tacniques he didnt use since classic DB. Its all there and I loved it. His new form im a little torn. I think the fact he finally gets simething is awesome. Well deserved screentime here.Gohan tho? Honestly the movie could have been a 8 or 9 for me if gohan was just completely not in it. Its so annoying he just transforms into something not even very special in the end and blasts the big bad dead. With piccolos move that he never used before. Stupid. Devalued piccolos power up big time and really destroyed the whole movie. At least for me.,first story really mix androidcell saga bio broly movie would ok db movies never stories imho villain cool actionand problems begin cell monster idk think sucked piccolo really mvp movie spy action clever moves wishes shenron tacniques didnt use since classic db loved new form im little torn think fact finally gets simething awesome well deserved screentime heregohan tho honestly movie could gohan completely annoying transforms something even special end blasts big bad dead piccolos move never used stupid devalued piccolos power big time really destroyed whole movie least

54,"A great addition to Super if you're a casual DBZ/S fan, and a must-watch if you're a Piccolo or Gohan fan! Man, did it feel refreshing to see them take the spotlight!

Pan was adorable and the Gammas were love at first sight; they stole the second act and had the best fight in the movie.

55,Been a loyal fan of the dragon ball franchise for 25+ years and this film really reinforced what my feelings have been for the last couple years.I enjoyed the Latest Broly film and there was some good parts of dragon ball super but on the whole they have ruined the franchise through making it seems like the audience they are aiming for are very young children? If you compare this latest film with dragon ball Z it really is sad to see how much it has regressed. I was sat in the cinema and it was actually to the point where it was painful it was that bad! No wonder fan made dragon ball anime on YT is getting removed when it is so much better than the rubbish they seem to be producing now!The transformations in this particular film make absolute no sense and the animation imo is shockingly bad.

56,"This movie was very bad, Dragon ball characters have always been characterized by showing their personality, in this movie the villain doesn't even say a word, he has no personality.Some people who have always been in the story lose their essence, for example Bulma leaves aside the technology for aesthetic things, as well as Pikoro and his change of attitude and tolerance towards the villain.For the creation of a Cell Max should have given more details of its operation, origin, reason for creation and also seems a little out of the story, as Trunks and Crilin finish with the laboratory and destroy everything related to the creation of cell, only take the plans of Android 17 and 18, so it was almost impossible to get all that information.I didn't like it, it's a movie made for 6-9 year old kids who don't need to know the story and laugh at simple jokes.",movie bad dragon ball characters always characterized showing personality movie villain doesnt even say word personalitysome people always story lose essence example bulma leaves aside technology aesthetic things well pikoro change attitude tolerance towards villainfor creation cell max given details operation origin reason creation also seems little story trunks crilin finish laboratory destroy everything related creation cell take plans android almost impossible get informationi didnt like movie made year old kids dont need know story laugh simple jokes

Like come on man and it's just a worse cell saga. The only reason goku and vegeta were in the movie even for a little while is cuz they're the face of dragon ball super. But they took cell's design and took everything that made him good away from him, and then they had the gall to say that they used Dr. Gero's documents for it. COME ON, HE WASN'T EVEN IN PERFECT FORM. And another thing that made cell great that they took from Cell max is his intelligence.

58,As title states. Highly disappointed in this and I've tried every single outlet short of Disney plus. If anybody has the link and is capable of sharing it with me that would be great. I just want to watch the movie but I like in Canada and that apparently makes me ineligible to watch the movie. It makes zero sense also that I have to write 600 words just to make this complaint. North America needs to regulate its viewing licenses better and have a proper control over who may and who may not view or purchase content. 1/10 and that's going to stay that way. How absurd is it that this far passed release I still can't watch it in Canada.,title states highly disappointed ive tried every single outlet short disney plus anybody link capable sharing would great want watch movie like canada apparently makes ineligible watch movie makes zero sense also write words make complaint north america needs regulate viewing licenses better proper control may may view purchase content thats going stay way absurd far passed release still cant watch canada
59,"This movie is a breathe of fresh air. High stakes, world ending drama that only the master Akira Toriyama can produce. It is a beautifully written & gorgeously animated story that puts Gohan & Piccolo as its centerpieces. Instead of a typical Dragon Ball storyline where the staples of the franchise(Goku & Vegeta) step in and save the day because only they are strong enough to defeat the villain. This movie focuses more on past supporting characters and allows them to shine as the heros. And shine they did! It's wonderful to see Gohan finally gets to show his true potential & power on screen and not just have it be talked about as a potential in the future. They dangled that carrot long enough. Pan's character arc made great strides in this film. It wasn't a lot, but it also wasn't over the top or overbearing. I'm very excited to see how her story progresses under the teachings of Piccolo(like father, like daughter). Trunks and Goten finally becoming teenagers is long over due and was something I was very happy to see. And the newest edition to the franchise, 'Gamma 2.' Gamma 2 is an awesome edition to the Dragon Ball roster. His personality, fighting style & abilities are not overly OP for an android. Hollywood could take a few notes from this movie on how to introduce a new character in a long storied & successful franchise(seriously).This is a fantastic movie. However it is not perfect. It does have its imperfections within the script, but I would like to preface, my gripes are very minimal & I don't think had these changes been implimented. It would not have improved upon the movie very much. The trailers from last summer felt misleading after watching. I'm very pleased with where this movie went and the areas it explored for the Gohan fandom that has been asking for this for 30+ years. However, I wish it could have been a tad more upfront about this instead of using Goku and Vegeta as its main selling point during the marketing campaign for its release. It's great that Gohan finally was able to break through his ceiling and being pushed beyond his limits. What lost me a bit was he shouldn't have been able to do so, given his lack of continuous training. Piccolo made a strong point of emphasis about this early in the film. He was only able to do so because of the hollywood Vin Diesel syndrome. ""Family."" The fact this franchise was built on the backs of Goku & Vegeta, it would have been nice to see them get more than 15 minutes of screen time throughout its runtime. It would have been nice to see what progress they both made in their training with Whis since their fight with Broly. With that being said, I'd like to reiterate that these are very minor gripes, and changing these things would not really improve upon the story.To sumerize, this was a fantastic story that introduced new characters and expanded upon several of the franchises' most beloved characters. I'm very excited to see how Toriyama implements Pan & Gamma 2, the ever expanding universe of Dragon Ball Super.",movie breathe fresh air high stakes world ending drama master akira toriyama produce beautifully written gorgeously animated story puts gohan piccolo centerpieces instead typical dragon ball storyline staples franchisegoku vegeta step save day strong enough defeat villain movie focuses past supporting characters allows shine heros shine wonderful see gohan finally gets show true potential power screen talked potential future dangled carrot long enough pans character arc made great strides film wasnt lot also wasnt top overbearing im excited see story progresses teachings piccololike father like daughter trunks goten finally becoming teenagers long due something happy see newest edition franchise gamma gamma awesome edition dragon ball roster personality fighting style abilities overly op android hollywood could take notes movie introduce new character long storied successful franchiseseriouslythis fantastic movie however perfect imperfections within script would like preface gripes minimal dont think changes implimented would improved upon movie much trailers last summer felt misleading watching im pleased movie went areas explored gohan fandom asking years however wish could tad upfront instead using goku vegeta main selling point marketing campaign release great gohan finally able break ceiling pushed beyond limits lost bit shouldnt able given lack continuous training piccolo made strong point emphasis early film able hollywood vin diesel syndrome family fact franchise built backs goku vegeta would nice see get minutes screen time throughout runtime would nice see progress made training whis since fight broly said id like reiterate minor gripes changing things would really improve upon storyto sumerize fantastic story introduced new characters expanded upon several franchises beloved characters im excited see toriyama implements pan gamma ever expanding universe dragon ball super
60,"The entire movie looked like Video game art from Budokai Tenkaichi cut scenes. The art style was completely different than the original Dragon Ball Super series. It was incredibly disappointing and definitely ruined any enjoyment I had watching the movie.Gohans transformation was incredibly Anticlimactic and boring, and absolutely no back story, he just randomly transforms from being far weaker than he was in the Tournament of Power... Again, the animation of the characters was so off it looked like fan art from photoshop.Lastly is the creation of Cell Max. This was one of the worst parts of the movie, being that they claimed he was far superior to the original Cell. But he could not talk, he didn't heal automatically, or regenerate, and he was unrealistically large like a giant. No back story to how they improved him from the original (did they get cells from other aliens that visit the planet like Beerus, or Whis etc?) They should have definitely kept him closer to the original Perfect Cell but more powerful and intelligent and change his appearance slightly. Having Wings was pointless as pretty much everyone can fly with energy.. he could have powered up to fly away instead of using his wings..Great Plot though, had a good story too it. Just incredibly disappointing designs and lack of information.",entire movie looked like video game art budokai tenkaichi cut scenes art style completely different original dragon ball super series incredibly disappointing definitely ruined enjoyment watching moviegohans transformation incredibly anticlimactic boring absolutely back story randomly transforms far weaker tournament power animation characters looked like fan art photoshoplastly creation cell max one worst parts movie claimed far superior original cell could talk didnt heal automatically regenerate unrealistically large like giant back story improved original get cells aliens visit planet like beerus whis etc definitely kept closer original perfect cell powerful intelligent change appearance slightly wings pointless pretty much everyone fly energy could powered fly away instead using wingsgreat plot though good story incredibly disappointing designs lack information
61,"I'm not a Dragon Ball fan, the only times I've watched it was back in childhood, when DB and DBZ were streamed on TV. So it's needless to say, that I went into it clueless with some very old and general knowledge of the series, thinking it's gonna be a waste of my time. But to my surprise I genuinely enjoyed the movie. It was really fun and lighthearted story, that casual (in this series) like me, would like. I could understand why some fans of the series might hate it as it's just a filler and doesn't really feature main characters that much or add some depth to the story and so on. Does the story have some deeper meaning? No. Does it rely on Dragon Ball on Dragon Ball series' jokes? Yes. But it's the nostalgia and some Dragon Ball well known shticks, that made whole theater burst out laughing several times during the movie. This self-awarness and campiness is what really sold me on it (also Piccolo and his big titties being main protagonist(-s), honestly, I remember liking Piccolo as a kid and this movie brought back that fondness, but in a slightly different way). Didn't mind the 3d animation, just in faster paced action scenes did it bother me a bit with cgi being too visible (if that makes sense). The color palette for the movie was pretty too. Overall an enjoyable, fun and easy watch.",im dragon ball fan times ive watched back childhood db dbz streamed tv needless say went clueless old general knowledge series thinking gonna waste time surprise genuinely enjoyed movie really fun lighthearted story casual series like would like could understand fans series might hate filler doesnt really feature main characters much add depth story story deeper meaning rely dragon ball dragon ball series jokes yes nostalgia dragon ball well known shticks made whole theater burst laughing several times movie selfawarness campiness really sold also piccolo big titties main protagonists honestly remember liking piccolo kid movie brought back fondness slightly different way didnt mind animation faster paced action scenes bother bit cgi visible makes sense color palette movie pretty overall enjoyable fun easy watch

Its so annoying he just transforms into something not even very special in the end and blasts the big bad dead. With piccolos move that he never used before. Stupid.

74,"This movie is a breathe of fresh air. High stakes, world ending drama that only the master Akira Toriyama can produce. It is a beautifully written & gorgeously animated story that puts Gohan & Piccolo as its centerpieces. Instead of a typical Dragon Ball storyline where the staples of the franchise(Goku & Vegeta) step in and save the day because only they are strong enough to defeat the villain. This movie focuses more on past supporting characters and allows them to shine as the heros. And shine they did! It's wonderful to see Gohan finally gets to show his true potential & power on screen and not just have it be talked about as a potential in the future. They dangled that carrot long enough. Pan's character arc made great strides in this film. It wasn't a lot, but it also wasn't over the top or overbearing. I'm very excited to see how her story progresses under the teachings of Piccolo(like father, like daughter). Trunks and Goten finally becoming teenagers is long over due and was something I was very happy to see. And the newest edition to the franchise, 'Gamma 2.' Gamma 2 is an awesome edition to the Dragon Ball roster. His personality, fighting style & abilities are not overly OP for an android. Hollywood could take a few notes from this movie on how to introduce a new character in a long storied & successful franchise(seriously).This is a fantastic movie. However it is not perfect. It does have its imperfections within the script, but I would like to preface, my gripes are very minimal & I don't think had these changes been implimented. It would not have improved upon the movie very much. The trailers from last summer felt misleading after watching. I'm very pleased with where this movie went and the areas it explored for the Gohan fandom that has been asking for this for 30+ years. However, I wish it could have been a tad more upfront about this instead of using Goku and Vegeta as its main selling point during the marketing campaign for its release. It's great that Gohan finally was able to break through his ceiling and being pushed beyond his limits. What lost me a bit was he shouldn't have been able to do so, given his lack of continuous training. Piccolo made a strong point of emphasis about this early in the film. He was only able to do so because of the hollywood Vin Diesel syndrome. ""Family."" The fact this franchise was built on the backs of Goku & Vegeta, it would have been nice to see them get more than 15 minutes of screen time throughout its runtime. It would have been nice to see what progress they both made in their training with Whis since their fight with Broly. With that being said, I'd like to reiterate that these are very minor gripes, and changing these things would not really improve upon the story.To sumerize, this was a fantastic story that introduced new characters and expanded upon several of the franchises' most beloved characters. I'm very excited to see how Toriyama implements Pan & Gamma 2, the ever expanding universe of Dragon Ball Super.",movie breathe fresh air high stakes world ending drama master akira toriyama produce beautifully written gorgeously animated story puts gohan piccolo centerpieces instead typical dragon ball storyline staples franchisegoku vegeta step save day strong enough defeat villain movie focuses past supporting characters allows shine heros shine wonderful see gohan finally gets show true potential power screen talked potential future dangled carrot long enough pans character arc made great strides film wasnt lot also wasnt top overbearing im excited see story progresses teachings piccololike father like daughter trunks goten finally becoming teenagers long due something happy see newest edition franchise gamma gamma awesome edition dragon ball roster personality fighting style abilities overly op android hollywood could take notes movie introduce new character long storied successful franchiseseriouslythis fantastic movie however perfect imperfections within script would like preface gripes minimal dont think changes implimented would improved upon movie much trailers last summer felt misleading watching im pleased movie went areas explored gohan fandom asking years however wish could tad upfront instead using goku vegeta main selling point marketing campaign release great gohan finally able break ceiling pushed beyond limits lost bit shouldnt able given lack continuous training piccolo made strong point emphasis early film able hollywood vin diesel syndrome family fact franchise built backs goku vegeta would nice see get minutes screen time throughout runtime would nice see progress made training whis since fight broly said id like reiterate minor gripes changing things would really improve upon storyto sumerize fantastic story introduced new characters expanded upon several franchises beloved characters im excited see toriyama implements pan gamma ever expanding universe dragon ball super
75,"The entire movie looked like Video game art from Budokai Tenkaichi cut scenes. The art style was completely different than the original Dragon Ball Super series. It was incredibly disappointing and definitely ruined any enjoyment I had watching the movie.Gohans transformation was incredibly Anticlimactic and boring, and absolutely no back story, he just randomly transforms from being far weaker than he was in the Tournament of Power... Again, the animation of the characters was so off it looked like fan art from photoshop.Lastly is the creation of Cell Max. This was one of the worst parts of the movie, being that they claimed he was far superior to the original Cell. But he could not talk, he didn't heal automatically, or regenerate, and he was unrealistically large like a giant. No back story to how they improved him from the original (did they get cells from other aliens that visit the planet like Beerus, or Whis etc?) They should have definitely kept him closer to the original Perfect Cell but more powerful and intelligent and change his appearance slightly. Having Wings was pointless as pretty much everyone can fly with energy.. he could have powered up to fly away instead of using his wings..Great Plot though, had a good story too it. Just incredibly disappointing designs and lack of information.",entire movie looked like video game art budokai tenkaichi cut scenes art style completely different original dragon ball super series incredibly disappointing definitely ruined enjoyment watching moviegohans transformation incredibly anticlimactic boring absolutely back story randomly transforms far weaker tournament power animation characters looked like fan art photoshoplastly creation cell max one worst parts movie claimed far superior original cell could talk didnt heal automatically regenerate unrealistically large like giant back story improved original get cells aliens visit planet like beerus whis etc definitely kept closer original perfect cell powerful intelligent change appearance slightly wings pointless pretty much everyone fly energy could powered fly away instead using wingsgreat plot though good story incredibly disappointing designs lack information
76,"I'm not a Dragon Ball fan, the only times I've watched it was back in childhood, when DB and DBZ were streamed on TV. So it's needless to say, that I went into it clueless with some very old and general knowledge of the series, thinking it's gonna be a waste of my time. But to my surprise I genuinely enjoyed the movie. It was really fun and lighthearted story, that casual (in this series) like me, would like. I could understand why some fans of the series might hate it as it's just a filler and doesn't really feature main characters that much or add some depth to the story and so on. Does the story have some deeper meaning? No. Does it rely on Dragon Ball on Dragon Ball series' jokes? Yes. But it's the nostalgia and some Dragon Ball well known shticks, that made whole theater burst out laughing several times during the movie. This self-awarness and campiness is what really sold me on it (also Piccolo and his big titties being main protagonist(-s), honestly, I remember liking Piccolo as a kid and this movie brought back that fondness, but in a slightly different way). Didn't mind the 3d animation, just in faster paced action scenes did it bother me a bit with cgi being too visible (if that makes sense). The color palette for the movie was pretty too. Overall an enjoyable, fun and easy watch.",im dragon ball fan times ive watched back childhood db dbz streamed tv needless say went clueless old general knowledge series thinking gonna waste time surprise genuinely enjoyed movie really fun lighthearted story casual series like would like could understand fans series might hate filler doesnt really feature main characters much add depth story story deeper meaning rely dragon ball dragon ball series jokes yes nostalgia dragon ball well known shticks made whole theater burst laughing several times movie selfawarness campiness really sold also piccolo big titties main protagonists honestly remember liking piccolo kid movie brought back fondness slightly different way didnt mind animation faster paced action scenes bother bit cgi visible makes sense color palette movie pretty overall enjoyable fun easy watch

78,"To be honest, at first I was really concerned about the CGI-Animation. Since DBS Broly looked so great with the shintani art style, It was really sad to hear this movie would not get the same treatment.After I saw the movie, I have to say: This is a really great Dragon Ball Movie and I am very happy with it. The animations are really good, the CGI looks really great. The story- althought not being the greatest- made sense and was different. Even though Goku and Vegeta did not play an important role in the movie, It was really fun to see Piccolo and Gohan in the main character role. The fights were amazing, and the movie had a great climax with Beast Gohan beating Cell Max. The only negative point would be the short period of time we saw Beast Gohan. But at the end of the day, It is a movie so the amount of time it has is limited.Overall a great movie.",honest first really concerned cgianimation since dbs broly looked great shintani art style really sad hear movie would get treatmentafter saw movie say really great dragon ball movie happy animations really good cgi looks really great story althought greatest made sense different even though goku vegeta play important role movie really fun see piccolo gohan main character role fights amazing movie great climax beast gohan beating cell max negative point would short period time saw beast gohan end day movie amount time limitedoverall great movie

Also The Animation Style That Dragon Ball Used Is Pretty Unique This Time And It Should Be Given A Chance Watching Such New Animation Style In Theatres Worked For Me But It Varies For Everyone.

It has great visuals even tho i was skeptical because of the cgi, i was gladly wrong.It makes sense that they could have been able to recreate Cell, since RRA were the only ones with the data from Dr Gero and his projects.Also love the fact that we can see how things developt when there's no Goku or Vegeta around to save the day.It has a good amount of fan service (Gohan Blanco), a new form for a fan favorite character (Piccolo), and the enemys have a motivation, (not like you, 90's Broly).

82,First of all the story is really just a mix of android/cell saga and bio broly movie. Which would have been ok as DB movies never have stories imho. Its more about the villain and cool action.And this is where the problems begin. That cell Monster? Idk I think it sucked. Piccolo is really the mvp of this movie. Spy action. Clever moves. Wishes from shenron. Tacniques he didnt use since classic DB. Its all there and I loved it. His new form im a little torn. I think the fact he finally gets simething is awesome. Well deserved screentime here.Gohan tho? Honestly the movie could have been a 8 or 9 for me if gohan was just completely not in it. Its so annoying he just transforms into something not even very special in the end and blasts the big bad dead. With piccolos move that he never used before. Stupid. Devalued piccolos power up big time and really destroyed the whole movie. At least for me.,first story really mix androidcell saga bio broly movie would ok db movies never stories imho villain cool actionand problems begin cell monster idk think sucked piccolo really mvp movie spy action clever moves wishes shenron tacniques didnt use since classic db loved new form im little torn think fact finally gets simething awesome well deserved screentime heregohan tho honestly movie could gohan completely annoying transforms something even special end blasts big bad dead piccolos move never used stupid devalued piccolos power big time really destroyed whole movie least

84,"A great addition to Super if you're a casual DBZ/S fan, and a must-watch if you're a Piccolo or Gohan fan! Man, did it feel refreshing to see them take the spotlight! Its issues mostly lie with pacing and way too much Red Ribbon backstory clogging up the run time, the worst offender being Toei missing a perfect opportunity to reprise Great Saiyaman, ESPECIALLY when ""superhero"" is its namesake!The comedy was on-point and had me laughing at every other line! Pan was adorable and the Gammas were love at first sight; they stole the second act and had the best fight in the movie. The CG is well-done and and really takes advantage of the cinematography and fighting choreography.

86,"This movie was very bad, Dragon ball characters have always been characterized by showing their personality, in this movie the villain doesn't even say a word, he has no personality.Some people who have always been in the story lose their essence, for example Bulma leaves aside the technology for aesthetic things, as well as Pikoro and his change of attitude and tolerance towards the villain.For the creation of a Cell Max should have given more details of its operation, origin, reason for creation and also seems a little out of the story, as Trunks and Crilin finish with the laboratory and destroy everything related to the creation of cell, only take the plans of Android 17 and 18, so it was almost impossible to get all that information.I didn't like it, it's a movie made for 6-9 year old kids who don't need to know the story and laugh at simple jokes.",movie bad dragon ball characters always characterized showing personality movie villain doesnt even say word personalitysome people always story lose essence example bulma leaves aside technology aesthetic things well pikoro change attitude tolerance towards villainfor creation cell max given details operation origin reason creation also seems little story trunks crilin finish laboratory destroy everything related creation cell take plans android almost impossible get informationi didnt like movie made year old kids dont need know story laugh simple jokes

But they took cell's design and took everything that made him good away from him, and then they had the gall to say that they used Dr. Gero's documents for it.

Overall a great Dragon Ball movie, probably a top 5.",one dragon ball movies actually story follow minutes text hour punches people want anyway great visuals even tho skeptical cgi gladly wrongit makes sense could able recreate cell since rra ones data dr gero projectsalso love fact see things developt theres goku vegeta around save dayit good amount fan service gohan blanco new form fan favorite character piccolo enemys motivation like broly overall great dragon ball movie probably top
97,First of all the story is really just a mix of android/cell saga and bio broly movie. Which would have been ok as DB movies never have stories imho. Its more about the villain and cool action.And this is where the problems begin. That cell Monster? Idk I think it sucked. Piccolo is really the mvp of this movie. Spy action. Clever moves. Wishes from shenron. Tacniques he didnt use since classic DB. Its all there and I loved it. His new form im a little torn. I think the fact he finally gets simething is awesome. Well deserved screentime here.Gohan tho? Honestly the movie could have been a 8 or 9 for me if gohan was just completely not in it. Its so annoying he just transforms into something not even very special in the end and blasts the big bad dead. With piccolos move that he never used before. Stupid. Devalued piccolos power up big time and really destroyed the whole movie. At least for me.,first story really mix androidcell saga bio broly movie would ok db movies never stories imho villain cool actionand problems begin cell monster idk think sucked piccolo really mvp movie spy action clever moves wishes shenron tacniques didnt use since classic db loved new form im little torn think fact finally gets simething awesome well deserved screentime heregohan tho honestly movie could gohan completely annoying transforms something even special end blasts big bad dead piccolos move never used stupid devalued piccolos power big time really destroyed whole movie least

99,"A great addition to Super if you're a casual DBZ/S fan, and a must-watch if you're a Piccolo or Gohan fan! Man, did it feel refreshing to see them take the spotlight! Its issues mostly lie with pacing and way too much Red Ribbon backstory clogging up the run time, the worst offender being Toei missing a perfect opportunity to reprise Great Saiyaman, ESPECIALLY when ""superhero"" is its namesake!The comedy was on-point and had me laughing at every other line! Pan was adorable and the Gammas were love at first sight; they stole the second act and had the best fight in the movie. The CG is well-done and and really takes advantage of the cinematography and fighting choreography. I wouldn't put it in my Top 5 DBZ/S movies, but it has a place in my Top 10 for a DBZ/S marathon.",great addition super youre casual dbzs fan mustwatch youre piccolo gohan fan man feel refreshing see take spotlight issues mostly lie pacing way much red ribbon backstory clogging run time worst offender toei missing perfect opportunity reprise great saiyaman especially superhero namesakethe comedy onpoint laughing every line pan adorable gammas love first sight stole second act best fight movie cg welldone really takes advantage cinematography fighting choreography wouldnt put top dbzs movies place top dbzs marathon
100,Been a loyal fan of the dragon ball franchise for 25+ years and this film really reinforced what my feelings have been for the last couple years.I enjoyed the Latest Broly film and there was some good parts of dragon ball super but on the whole they have ruined the franchise through making it seems like the audience they are aiming for are very young children? If you compare this latest film with dragon ball Z it really is sad to see how much it has regressed. I was sat in the cinema and it was actually to the point where it was painful it was that bad! No wonder fan made dragon ball anime on YT is getting removed when it is so much better than the rubbish they seem to be producing now!The transformations in this particular film make absolute no sense and the animation imo is shockingly bad. This was the GOAT programme but now the likes of demon slayer and AOT is leaving dragon ball for dust!I cannot understand how people who are life long dragon ball fans can rate this film so highly? I never write reviews but I was that disappointed I felt I had to!,loyal fan dragon ball franchise years film really reinforced feelings last couple yearsi enjoyed latest broly film good parts dragon ball super whole ruined franchise making seems like audience aiming young children compare latest film dragon ball z really sad see much regressed sat cinema actually point painful bad wonder fan made dragon ball anime yt getting removed much better rubbish seem producing nowthe transformations particular film make absolute sense animation imo shockingly bad goat programme likes demon slayer aot leaving dragon ball dusti cannot understand people life long dragon ball fans rate film highly never write reviews disappointed felt
101,"This movie was very bad, Dragon ball characters have always been characterized by showing their personality, in this movie the villain doesn't even say a word, he has no personality.Some people who have always been in the story lose their essence, for example Bulma leaves aside the technology for aesthetic things, as well as Pikoro and his change of attitude and tolerance towards the villain.For the creation of a Cell Max should have given more details of its operation, origin, reason for creation and also seems a little out of the story, as Trunks and Crilin finish with the laboratory and destroy everything related to the creation of cell, only take the plans of Android 17 and 18, so it was almost impossible to get all that information.I didn't like it, it's a movie made for 6-9 year old kids who don't need to know the story and laugh at simple jokes.",movie bad dragon ball characters always characterized showing personality movie villain doesnt even say word personalitysome people always story lose essence example bulma leaves aside technology aesthetic things well pikoro change attitude tolerance towards villainfor creation cell max given details operation origin reason creation also seems little story trunks crilin finish laboratory destroy everything related creation cell take plans android almost impossible get informationi didnt like movie made year old kids dont need know story laugh simple jokes
102,"Like honestly, Akira, you are ruining your legacy. This had so much potential, what is this. Piccolo's big transformation is called Orange piccolo. Like come on man and it's just a worse cell saga. The only reason goku and vegeta were in the movie even for a little while is cuz they're the face of dragon ball super. But they took cell's design and took everything that made him good away from him, and then they had the gall to say that they used Dr. Gero's documents for it. COME ON, HE WASN'T EVEN IN PERFECT FORM. And another thing that made cell great that they took from Cell max is his intelligence. Cell max was said to be complete in the movie he was just beserk the entire time.",like honestly akira ruining legacy much potential piccolos big transformation called orange piccolo like come man worse cell saga reason goku vegeta movie even little cuz theyre face dragon ball super took cells design took everything made good away gall say used dr geros documents come wasnt even perfect form another thing made cell great took cell max intelligence cell max said complete movie beserk entire time
103,As title states. Highly disappointed in this and I've tried every single outlet short of Disney plus. If anybody has the link and is capable of sharing it with me that would be great. I just want to watch the movie but I like in Canada and that apparently makes me ineligible to watch the movie. It makes zero sense also that I have to write 600 words just to make this complaint. North America needs to regulate its viewing licenses better and have a proper control over who may and who may not view or purchase content. 1/10 and that's going to stay that way. How absurd is it that this far passed release I still can't watch it in Canada.,title states highly disappointed ive tried every single outlet short disney plus anybody link capable sharing would great want watch movie like canada apparently makes ineligible watch movie makes zero sense also write words make complaint north america needs regulate viewing licenses better proper control may may view purchase content thats going stay way absurd far passed release still cant watch canada
104,"This movie is a breathe of fresh air. High stakes, world ending drama that only the master Akira Toriyama can produce. It is a beautifully written & gorgeously animated story that puts Gohan & Piccolo as its centerpieces. Instead of a typical Dragon Ball storyline where the staples of the franchise(Goku & Vegeta) step in and save the day because only they are strong enough to defeat the villain. This movie focuses more on past supporting characters and allows them to shine as the heros. And shine they did! It's wonderful to see Gohan finally gets to show his true potential & power on screen and not just have it be talked about as a potential in the future. They dangled that carrot long enough. Pan's character arc made great strides in this film. It wasn't a lot, but it also wasn't over the top or overbearing. I'm very excited to see how her story progresses under the teachings of Piccolo(like father, like daughter). Trunks and Goten finally becoming teenagers is long over due and was something I was very happy to see. And the newest edition to the franchise, 'Gamma 2.' Gamma 2 is an awesome edition to the Dragon Ball roster. His personality, fighting style & abilities are not overly OP for an android. Hollywood could take a few notes from this movie on how to introduce a new character in a long storied & successful franchise(seriously).This is a fantastic movie. However it is not perfect. It does have its imperfections within the script, but I would like to preface, my gripes are very minimal & I don't think had these changes been implimented. It would not have improved upon the movie very much. The trailers from last summer felt misleading after watching. I'm very pleased with where this movie went and the areas it explored for the Gohan fandom that has been asking for this for 30+ years. However, I wish it could have been a tad more upfront about this instead of using Goku and Vegeta as its main selling point during the marketing campaign for its release. It's great that Gohan finally was able to break through his ceiling and being pushed beyond his limits. What lost me a bit was he shouldn't have been able to do so, given his lack of continuous training. Piccolo made a strong point of emphasis about this early in the film. He was only able to do so because of the hollywood Vin Diesel syndrome. ""Family."" The fact this franchise was built on the backs of Goku & Vegeta, it would have been nice to see them get more than 15 minutes of screen time throughout its runtime. It would have been nice to see what progress they both made in their training with Whis since their fight with Broly. With that being said, I'd like to reiterate that these are very minor gripes, and changing these things would not really improve upon the story.To sumerize, this was a fantastic story that introduced new characters and expanded upon several of the franchises' most beloved characters. I'm very excited to see how Toriyama implements Pan & Gamma 2, the ever expanding universe of Dragon Ball Super.",movie breathe fresh air high stakes world ending drama master akira toriyama produce beautifully written gorgeously animated story puts gohan piccolo centerpieces instead typical dragon ball storyline staples franchisegoku vegeta step save day strong enough defeat villain movie focuses past supporting characters allows shine heros shine wonderful see gohan finally gets show true potential power screen talked potential future dangled carrot long enough pans character arc made great strides film wasnt lot also wasnt top overbearing im excited see story progresses teachings piccololike father like daughter trunks goten finally becoming teenagers long due something happy see newest edition franchise gamma gamma awesome edition dragon ball roster personality fighting style abilities overly op android hollywood could take notes movie introduce new character long storied successful franchiseseriouslythis fantastic movie however perfect imperfections within script would like preface gripes minimal dont think changes implimented would improved upon movie much trailers last summer felt misleading watching im pleased movie went areas explored gohan fandom asking years however wish could tad upfront instead using goku vegeta main selling point marketing campaign release great gohan finally able break ceiling pushed beyond limits lost bit shouldnt able given lack continuous training piccolo made strong point emphasis early film able hollywood vin diesel syndrome family fact franchise built backs goku vegeta would nice see get minutes screen time throughout runtime would nice see progress made training whis since fight broly said id like reiterate minor gripes changing things would really improve upon storyto sumerize fantastic story introduced new characters expanded upon several franchises beloved characters im excited see toriyama implements pan gamma ever expanding universe dragon ball super
